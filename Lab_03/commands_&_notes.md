version 04 works however it has rule mismatched issues
also version 04 doesn't go past one lexeme

version 05 should be an updated version where 
unified identifier rule to match both keywords and normal identifiers 
UNFORTUNATELY< VER05 doesn't do the job>
errors: cc1plus.exe: fatal error: y.tab.c: No such file or directory

version 06 on the way: VOILA


    The problem is that our keyword rules are being placed after the general {id} rule, which matches any identifier. Since Flex uses the "longest match" rule and processes patterns in order, the {id} pattern will always match keywords before the specific keyword rules can be applied.


* LAB02 
done with scope and symbol table and symbol info need to integreate this with .y file
Every {} should create a new scope table with a unique ID
what I was doing was only creating function bodies and control structures to create new scopes

Additionally, ``` func_definition``` rules, ensure the function is being inserted into the global scope (scope #1), not a local scope. The function should be inserted before entering the new scope for the function body.

Main issue that I faced was shift reduced by 1/ times* lines

The main change I made is removing the embedded action from the var_declaration rule.

```
var_declaration : type_specifier {
        // Stores current variable type
        current_var_type = $1->getname();
        var_names.clear();
        array_sizes.clear();
    } declaration_list SEMICOLON
```

Change was made to ``` var_declaration : type_specifier declaration_list SEMICOLON ```

The embedded action in the middle of a grammar rule can cause shift/reduce conflicts 
because the parser doesn't know whether to continue parsing the rule or execute the action. 
This was causing my parser to fail when it encountered the ```declaration_list``` after ```type_specifier INT```.

```
rm -f y.tab.c y.tab.h y.output lex.yy.c a.out y.o l.o my_log.txt a.exe my_error.txt
