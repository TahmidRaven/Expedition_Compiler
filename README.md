#  Expedition Compiler


**For all those who come after.**
*Embark on a journey through syntax and semantics ‚Äî one token at a time.*


The **Expedition Compiler** is a C-based compiler project built with Lex and Yacc (Flex/Bison), designed for academic and adventurous use. Inspired by the mystery and challenge of fantasy journeys, it parses source code with precision and style.

## üîß Features

- Lexical analysis with Flex
- Syntax parsing with Bison
- Token and error logging
- Fantasy-themed output structuring
- Modular symbol table system

## üì¶ Structure

- `21201701_lex.l`: Lexical analyzer
- `21201701_syn.y`: Syntax parser
- `symbol_info.h`: Symbol table management
- `input/`: Source code samples
- `output/`: Generated logs, parse trees, symbol tables

## üßô Lore-Driven Philosophy

> ‚ÄúNot all code that compiles is gold. But this compiler seeks the truth in the syntax.‚Äù

> ‚Äú**When one falls, we continue.** Not *if* ‚Äî *when*. Because every expedition is built on the courage to rise again.‚Äù

> ‚Äú**For all those who come after.** The path we walk is forged not just for ourselves, but for the future travelers of this language wilderness.‚Äù

This compiler is more than a tool ‚Äî it's a testament. Each token parsed, each rule matched, each bug vanquished is part of an eternal march. We don‚Äôt quit. We *compile*.

              v
   +------------------------+
   |  Lexical Analysis      | <-- Converts source code into tokens.
   +------------------------+
              |
              v
   +------------------------+
   |  Syntax Analysis       | <-- Builds a parse tree from the tokens.
   +------------------------+
              |
              v
   +------------------------+
   |  Semantic Analysis     | <-- Ensures the program follows language rules (type checking, scope, etc.).
   +------------------------+
              |
              v
   +------------------------+
   |  Intermediate Code     | <-- Converts the parse tree to an intermediate representation (e.g., three-address code).
   +------------------------+
              |
              v
   +------------------------+
   |  Code Optimization     | <-- Improves the intermediate code for better performance or memory usage.
   +------------------------+
              |
              v
   +------------------------+
   |  Code Generation       | <-- Converts the intermediate code into target machine code (assembly or machine code).
   +------------------------+
              |
              v
   +------------------------+
   |  Executable Program    | <-- Final executable code ready for execution.
