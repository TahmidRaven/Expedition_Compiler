#  Expedition Compiler


**For all those who come after.**
*Embark on a journey through syntax and semantics — one token at a time.*


The **Expedition Compiler** is a C-based compiler project built with Lex and Yacc (Flex/Bison), designed for academic and adventurous use. Inspired by the mystery and challenge of fantasy journeys, it parses source code with precision and style.

## 🧙 Lore-Driven Philosophy

> “Not all code that compiles is gold. But this compiler seeks the truth in the syntax.”

> “**When one falls, we continue.** Not *if* — *when*. Because every expedition is built on the courage to rise again.”

> “**For all those who come after.** The path we walk is forged not just for ourselves, but for the future travelers of this language wilderness.”

This compiler is more than a tool — it's a testament. Each token parsed, each rule matched, each bug vanquished is part of an eternal march. We don’t quit. We *compile*.
